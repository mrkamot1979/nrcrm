NR Client Management System
=======

Overview
-----------
A couple of years ago I created a Query Logging software using PHP/Apache/MySQL for the helpdesk that I used to work for so I thought of doing something similar again but with a few other "improvements".  The main purpose of this project was to re acquaint myself with programming and to learn using Git and GitHub.

The idea behind this software was a peculiar request from a colleague who wanted to build a client management system that would trackk who/what/where/when client visits/interactions were made and i thought it was doable using PHP.
 
Technologies used:
   * PHP
   * MySQL
   * Apache

I used the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) bundle to make things easy to install.
